# Projects

Hi! My name is Alex Devine and I am a junior at the University of Michigan College of Engineering. I am majoring in computer science and minoring in business. This repository contains a few projects I have worked on over the last few years. More information regarding the specifics of each individual project and how to run each project can be found inside the project's folder.


# Network Intrusion Detection

This project trains a support vector machine to predict if network accesses are safe or present the threat of an intrusion. This model was able to achieve 99.99% accuracy on a dataset from a the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. This project was completed in Python while utilizing the sci-kit learn library. 


# Neuroevolution

This project is ongoing as part of the Michigan Data Science Team. I am learning to use reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms in Pytorch to train neural networks. 


# Trip Planner

This project combines the OpenAI, Tripadvisor, and Flight API using Python and Streamlit to create a chatbot that users can interact with to get relevant flight, hotel, and attraction information in any location.


# Tumor Detection

This project uses Matlab to make a simple classifier using matrix singular value decposition to detect if a brain MRI scan contains a tumor.
