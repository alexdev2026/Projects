# TripPlanner

This project was developed as a chatbot to aid in planning any kind of trip: business, vacation, etc. By combining the OpenAI GPT-4, TripAdvisor, and Flight APIs, this project gathers online information and presents it to the user as advice for booking flights, finding hotels, and discovering restaurants in the area provided. The user can also ask for images, reviews, price, and additional information about the locations requested. Using StreamLit, I built a frontend interface to allow users to converse with the program as a chatbot.

To run this project, use the download all required libraries using the requirements.txt file, and then run the main.py file. Once the TripPlanner frontend interface appears, you can begin conversing with the chatbot.
